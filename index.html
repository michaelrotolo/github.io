		<p>Michael Rotolo is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Sociology at Notre Dame. His research examines the interplay of religion, morality, and politics in America. His published work focuses primarily on the views and experiences of youth and young adults, as well as how parents transmit their beliefs and values to their children. </p>
		<p>Michael's book, <a target="_blank" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/30088.html"><i>Religious Parenting: Transmitting Faith and Values in Contemporary America</i></a> (Princeton University Press 2020), coauthored with Christian Smith and Bridget Ritz, explores American parentsâ€™ strategies, experiences, and beliefs regarding religious transmission to their children using hundreds of in-depth interviews with parents from around the United States.</p>
		<p>His dissertation, "Seeking the Good Life: The Moral Development of Young People in America," examines how Americans develop their moral views, drawing on survey and interview data with young people collected over the course of 10 years from adolescence to young adulthood. The first chapter explores how young adults' moral views shape their religious engagement. The second chapter examines the development of Christian nationalist ideological views. The third chapter focuses on the development of liberal and conservative political orientations.</p>
		<p>Michael holds an M.A. in Sociology from Notre Dame, an M.Div from Princeton Theological Seminary, and a B.A. in Religious Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is also a graduate of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.</p>
