		<p>Michael Rotolo is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Sociology at Notre Dame. His research examines the origins, development, and outcomes of morality across the life course, with an emphasis on religion, culture, and politics. His current work focuses on American adolescents, young adults, and families and engages cutting-edge research on cognition, emotion, and perception.</p>
		<p>Michael's book, <a target="_blank" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/30088.html"><i>Religious Parenting: Transmitting Faith and Values in Contemporary America</i></a> (Princeton University Press 2020), coauthored with Christian Smith and Bridget Ritz, explores American parentsâ€™ strategies, experiences, and beliefs regarding religious transmission to their children using hundreds of in-depth interviews with parents from around America.</p>
		<p>His dissertation, "Seeking the Good Life: The Moral Development of Young People in America," examines how Americans develop their moral views, drawing primarily on interview data with young people collected over the course of 10 years from adolescence to young adulthood. One of his recent chapters examines the development of Christian nationalist ideology on the far-right. Another focuses on the development of "Extremely Liberal" ideology on the far-left.</p>
		<p>Michael holds an M.A. in Sociology from Notre Dame, an M.Div from Princeton Theological Seminary, and a B.A. in Religious Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is also a graduate of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.</p>
