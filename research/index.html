			<h2>Religion and Society</h2>
			<p>An interest in race and religion led me to sociology. My final two years of undergrad were almost exclusively dedicated to Sociology and Religious Studies courses. I then went to seminary where I focused on theology, philosophy, and ethics that critically engage culture and society. Religion continues to play a highly influential role in society, but studies of religion need innovation, which I seek to bring in my work. My paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12572">"Religion Imagined,"</a> examines how American adults conceive of religion's role in life at an unconscious level. My paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/socrel/sraa025">"Moral Religiosities,"</a> identifies how different moral orientations support different forms of religiosity among young adults. My book, <a target="_blank" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/30088.html"><i>Religious Parenting</i></a>, explores parents' beliefs and strategies for transmitting faith to their children.</p>

			<h2>Culture and Cognition</h2>
			<p>A major goal of my research is to better understand how peopel think. I am particularly interested in the interplay of cultural and cognitive processes in human meaning-making. Since we frequently ask questions and make assumptions about humans’ motivations, it is crucial to advance our understandings of how human cognition works and how cultural knowledge is acquired, organized, and used. My article, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1057/s41290-021-00135-0">"Culture Beneath Discourse,"</a> theorizes various emergent levels of cultural knowledge and how they form more complex cultural understandings. My book, <a target="_blank" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/30088.html"><i>Religious Parenting</i></a>, advances a “cultural models” approach for understanding and studying how culture works. My dissertation projects also highlight the various ways moral intuitions, emotional development, and perception influence ideological views.</p>

			<h2>Moral Development</h2>
			<p>My research also examines moral development across the life course. Scholarship across disciplines shows that we humans inescapably perceive and evaluate the world through moral categories, such as good/bad, worthy/unworthy, and just/unjust. Likewise, we constantly appeal to various morals—such as care, liberty, and loyalty—as we develop our identities and seek to explain our attitudes and actions. My various projects examine how our conceptions of morality develop, whether and how those views change over time as we navigate life, as well as socially significant outcomes of our moral views. My dissertation examines young Americans’ moral development over 10 years (from roughly middle school until their mid-20s), drawing on 4 waves of nationally-representative surveys, in-depth interviews, and field notes. I also have several ongoing projects that examine how morality influences political views, including one project focused on Christian nationalism, one focused on liberal and conservative political orientations, and another focused on notions of Sanctity/Purity.
