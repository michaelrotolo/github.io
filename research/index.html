			<h2>Moral Development</h2>
			<p>My research focuses primarily on the origins, development, and outcomes of different moral views.  My dissertation examines young Americans’ moral development over 10 years (from ages 13-18 until 23-28), drawing on 4 waves of in-depth interview, field notes, and survey data. I have a one project that explores the development of Christian nationalist ideological views among American young adults. On the other end of the political spectrum, I am working on a project that examines how millennials develop "Extremely Liberal" political orientations, including those who identify as socialists, communists, and anarchists. I also have a project that analyzes the development, cultural variation, and sociopolitical outcomes of the "Sanctity" moral foundation through application of a Moral Foundations Dictionary to longitudinal interview data.

			<h2>Religion and Society</h2>
			<p>An interest in race and religion led me to sociology. My final two years of undergrad were almost exclusively dedicated to Sociology and Religious Studies courses. I then went to seminary where I focused on theology, philosophy, and ethics that critically engaged culture and society. Religion continues to play a pervasive role in society, but studies of religion need <i>major innovation</i>, which I seek to bring in my work. My paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12572">"Religion Imagined,"</a> investigates the implicit conceptual structures beneath American adults' conscious religious understandings. My paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/socrel/sraa025">"Moral Religiosities,"</a> identifies how different moral orientations support different forms of religiosity among young adults.</p>

			<h2>Culture, Cognition, and Emotion</h2>
			<p>I also have a theoretical interest in culture, cognition, and emotion, which influences all of my studies. My <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12572">Master’s thesis</a> drew on the cognitive sciences to theorize the influence of “image schemas” in implicitly structuring cultural understandings. My working paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v39te/">"Culture Beneath Discourse,"</a> theorizes various emergent levels of cultural knowledge and how they aggregate to form complex cultural structures. My book, <a target="_blank" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/30088.html"><i>Religious Parenting</i></a>, advances a “cultural models” approach for theorizing how culture works. My dissertation projects highlight the various ways emotional development influences ideological views.</p>
